Hippo is a collection of well crafted go packages that help you build robust, reliable, maintainable microservices. It is not a full-fledged framework with lot of magic, predefined architecture, specific patterns and opinions so you will be the one behind the wheel.

It provides libraries to implement components for service discovery, async jobs, authentication, authorization, logging, caching, metrics, tracing, rate-limiting...etc which are essential requirements for running microservices in production.
